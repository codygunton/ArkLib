# Lookahead sequence family and procedure

This file contains the lookahead sequence family and procedure for the analysis of duplex sponge
Fiat-Shamir, following Section 5.3 in the paper.

## Paper-faithful black-box `tr_∇.p` access

Following CO25 §5.3, `LookAhead` consults the simulator's permutation table `tr_∇.p` exclusively
through the operational interface `TraceTableOps.inlu`. Concretely:

* `successorCandidates trΔp s` collapses to `tr_∇.p.inlu(s)` plus the no-loop guard
  `cap(s) ≠ cap(s')`. When `inlu = ⟂` (zero **or** multiple matches), the procedure terminates
  the chain — matching the paper's Algorithm 2 spec.
* `LookaheadSequence trΔp state` carries an `inlu`-membership invariant, so callers reason about
  the abstract `Multiset (K × V)` model rather than the raw `forwardPermutationOracle` query log.

By parameterizing every step over `[LawfulTraceTable T_P ...]`, the executable procedure and the
soundness lemmas built atop `LookaheadSequence` are entirely independent of the concrete trace
representation; swapping the list-backed default for an `RBMap`-backed implementation requires no
proof changes.

noncomputable section

/-- A look-ahead sequence (Equation 14) over a black-box permutation table `tr_∇.p` and an
  initial state, consists of:
- A list of `(s_in, s_out)` query-answer pairs,

subject to the following conditions:
- The list is nonempty
- The first input state is the given initial state
- Every pair appears as a unique forward lookup in `tr_∇.p`, i.e. `inlu trΔp s_in = some s_out`
- Consecutive pairs are linked by output/input equality
- No-loop: `cap(s_in) ≠ cap(s_out)` at every step
