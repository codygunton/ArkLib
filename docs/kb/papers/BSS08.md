# BSS08

## At A Glance

`BSS08` is a historical folding/division reference used in ArkLib's STIR folding development.
It appears as supporting background rather than as the main protocol paper.

## What ArkLib Uses From This Paper

- Background for the bivariate division and folding constructions cited in
  [`ArkLib/ProofSystem/Stir/Folding.lean`](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/Stir/Folding.lean).
- A source for the proposition-level polynomial identities that STIR reuses.

## Main ArkLib Touchpoints

- [`ArkLib/ProofSystem/Stir/Folding.lean`](../../../ArkLib/ProofSystem/Stir/Folding.lean) cites
  `BSS08` directly and references Proposition 6.3 in comments and definitions.

## Version Notes

- Although this is not the main STIR paper, it is part of the proof lineage for the folding layer
  currently being formalized.

## Known Divergences From ArkLib

- ArkLib reaches the relevant constructions through Mathlib's multivariate polynomial and Groebner
  tooling instead of mirroring the original exposition directly.

## Open Formalization Gaps

- The STIR folding file still contains substantial proof gaps, so this paper currently supports
  partial formalization rather than a finished verified layer.
